            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How A Man's Fitbit Got Him The Medical Care He Needed</h1><p>On Jan. 5, a man checked into a hospital's emergency room in Camden, New Jersey.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>eero: No More Internet Dead Zones</h1><p>Nearly all homes have a WiFi dead zone: you never get messages in the kitchen, you can't watch Netflix in the bedroom, you can't FaceTime in the backyard.
